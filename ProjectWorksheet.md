## Project Description

I will be building a music and audio App that will play my music, using React and import data through a Contenful API that will be implemented in my app. I would like it to display a main page with album artwork and then give you the ability to list albums, songs, and artist information. I would also like to include an audio player that would play music of the artist you clicked on.

## Additional Libraries

Contentful

SCSS

## Code Snippet

This is the code I used to bring in my API data through Contenful. I used a class component which fetched my API through my client.js component which stored my data for the Contenful API.

```
class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    music: [],
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    client
      .getEntries()
      .then((response) => {
        console.log("Response -", response);
        this.setState({
          music: response.items,
        });
      })
      .catch(console.error);
  }
```
